T he edge load \ncondition gives an intermediate value.  \n \nTemperature stresses at the edge are calculated by using Bradbury’s formula. The \ntemperature stresses in the corner region is negligible as the corners are relatively free to \nwrap and may be ignored.  \n \nThe design wheel load stress and the temperature stress at the edge are then added up \ntogether and this summation shall be less than 28 days flexural strength of concrete for the \nassumed thickness to be adequate from design point of view.  \nOnce the assumed slab thickness is found adequate for the combined stresses developed due \nto temperature and design wheel load, its adequacy needs to be checked from the view point \nof its consumption of fatigue resistance. In this case also, edge stresses are computed as \ndiscussed earlier for various axle load classes. Then stress ratio (SR) is calculated as ratio of \nstress due to wheel load and the 28 days flexural strength of concrete for all axle load class. \nConsumption of fatigue resistance is computed for this stress ratio for each axle load class. \nSummation of this consumption of fatigue resistance should not exceed the allowable limit for \nthe assumed thickness to be adequate from the view point of fatigue consideration.  \n \nDesign of Joints  \nOnce", "DEVELOPMENT OF 'GANGA EXPRESSWAY' FROM MEERUT TO \nPRAYAGRAJ, AN ACCESS CONTROLLED GREENFIELD \nEXPRESSWAY PROJECT \nDETAILED PROJECT REPORT \n6.

The \nmethodology adopted for the project is based on initial studies, secondary data, traffic \nanalysis, topographic survey, revenue calculations and Cost Estimates. The project area \nsocial screening/RAP and Environment Impact Assessment are also completed for the \ndetailed Engineering stage (DPR). The government policies about Land acquisition is also \ncovered in the detailed Engineering st age (DPR). The methodology  adopted is in line with \nthe requirements of the ToR. The methodology adopted to arrive at detailed Engineering \nstage is covered in chapter 3. Detailed Engineering and field studies such as soil \ninvestigations, Environment Impact Analysis and design works are completed for the most \npreferred alignment Option-1.', 's of the project study. The main approach of this consultancy \nservice comprise of the following: \n(a) The Greenfield alignment is within the proposed Right of Way (ROW); \n(b) The most economical but sound proposal is arrived at for the required roadwork and \nrelated bridge works; \n(c) Engineering, economic, environmental and social feasibility studies of the proposed road \nimprovements are carried out keeping in view of several important aspects of project \nexecution. \n(d) International “best practices” including use of “State of the art” and computer based survey \nand design techniques (e.g. GPS, Total Station Survey, LiDAR, Compu ter Aided Designs \n(MX/MOSS/Equivalent etc.) is incorporated for preparation of the technical proposal, \ndevelopment of designs, cost estimates, bid documents etc.; \n(e) Preliminary designs of the agreed road and related bridge works is prepared, as a basis for \ncompleting Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) shall be prepared; \n(f) Reports and analysis shall be provided, suitable for meeting the standards and \nspecifications laid down according to Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MORTH), \nGovernment of India requirements on environmental and social assessment. \n1.7 STRUCTURE OF DETAILED PROJECT REPORT \nThe Detailed Project Report has been divided in following volumes: \nVolume-I:      Main Report \nVolume-II:    Cost Estimates  \nVolume-III:  Rate Analysis']]
